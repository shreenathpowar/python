# Python


## 1. Modules and Pip

**Modules**: Modules are used to borrow someone else's code. basically use code written by some other person(s) in our code. 
Also other people can use our code in thier code with the help of modules (we need to create module of our code and then publish it)

**Types of Module**:
  1. **Built in modules:** Modules which comes out of the box with Python Installation e.g. Math, Random, os, Shutil
  2. **External Modules:** Modules which are created by someone else and published on remote repository that we can install in our machine e.g. Pandas, Cryptography

**Why Modules?**
to purely focus on functionality we are working on and not to repeat ourself writing code for something which is already written so that we can save our time and efforts.
Also Modules are used by lots of programmers hence they are well tested.

**Installing External Module:**

>```cmd
>pip install pandas

confirm installtion

>```python
>import pandas
>
